<p>This app requires:<br>
python<br>
python-pyqt5<br>
wget<br>
linux-wallpaperengine-git<br>
waypaper<br>
swww
<p>

To use, download and run 'install.sh'<br>
To add it as an app that shows up in launchers, as well as adding a dedicated command, download and run 'add-to-apps.sh'<br>

<p>After it is installed, run 'python ~/.config/WallpaperSelect/WallpaperSelect.py' to select a wallpaper.<br>
  If you ran 'add-to-apps.sh', you can just run the 'wallpaper-select' command to select a wallpaper instead.<br>
Both can be ran with a button in something like Waybar to make it easier to launch.
